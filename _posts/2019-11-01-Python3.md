#### An underscore ( _ ) in python 3
1. When used in interpreter
the last expression value.
```python
    >>> 10  
    10  
    >>> _    
    10
```
2. Ignore a value when unpacking.
```python
x, _, z = (1, 2, 3) # x=1 and z=3  
for _, value2 in list_of_tuple:
    something()
```
3. _single_leading_underscore  
    > Weak internal use indicator
    
    The convention is used for declaring **private** variables, functions, methods, classes in a module.  
    __import *__  ignore Anything with this convention.  
    But, python does not support truly private, so we can call it directly from other modules.  

4. single_trailing_underscore_  
This convention could be used for avoiding conflict with python keywords or built-ins.You might not use it often.  
class_, list_, ....etc

5. __double_leading_underscore
    > It is syntax.
    
    In python, __ will mangle the attribute name of a class to avoid conflict of attribute names between classes.  
    Inside class A, "__run" becomes "_A__run" . So we can not access with "A.__run". 

6. \_\_double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__  
    This convection is used for special variables or methods. (so-called "Magic method") such as \_\_init__, \_\_len__.
    A user of course can make custom special method, it is very rare case, but often might modify the some special built-in methods.
